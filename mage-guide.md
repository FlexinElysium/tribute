Our current goal is to get our Onyxia and Molten Core clears as efficient as possible.  We want to 1-shot Onyxia every time and clear MC in 90 minutes.  These are the things you can do to help:

  * Get your pre-raid best in slot gear.  There's a huge difference in damage output between a mage just hitting 60 and a mage who has spent the time to obtain the best items for each slot.  The following is written specifically for patch 1.3 as it exists on Elysium.
    * Head:
      * **[\[Dragonskin Cowl\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=22225)** or **[\[Cap of the Scarlet Savant\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=12752)**
      * Enchant: **[\[Arcanum of Focus\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18330)**
    * Neck: **[\[Tempest Talisman\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18317)**
    * Shoulders: **[\[Boreal Mantle\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=11782)**
      * Enchant: **[\[Flame Mantle of the Dawn\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18169)**
    * Chest: **[\[Robe of the Archmage\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=14152)**, **[\[Freezing Lich Robes\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=14340)**, or **[\[Robe of Winter Night\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=14136)**
      * Enchant: **[\[Stats\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=13941)** or **[\[Greater Stats\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=20025)**
    * Wrist: **[\[Sublime Wristguards\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18497)**
      * Enchant: **[\[Greater Intellect\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=20008)**
    * Hands: **[\[Gloves of Spell Mastery\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=14146)**, **[\[Hands of Power\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=13253)**, or **[\[Knight-Lieutenant's Silk Gloves\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=16391)**
    * Waist: **[\[Clutch of Andros\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=13956)** or **[\[Belt of the Archmage\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18405)**
    * Feet: **[\[Riptide Shoes\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18307)** or **[\[Knight-Lieutenant's Silk Boots\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=16369)**
      * Enchant: **[\[Minor Speed\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=13890)**
    * Fingers: **[\[Songstone of Ironforge\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=12543)**, **[\[Maiden's Circle\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=13001)**, or **[\[Freezing Band\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=942)**
    * Trinkets: **[\[Eye of the Beast\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=13968)** and **[\[Briarwood Reed\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=12930)**
    * Weapon: **[\[Rod of the Ogre Magi\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18534)**
      * Enchant: **[\[Major Intellect\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=20084)**
    * Wand: **[\[Freezing Shard\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=10572)**, **[\[Bonekreeper Stylus\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18534)**, or **[\[Icefury Wand\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=7514)**

 (note: the statistics from the vanillagaming website are from patch 1.4.  Elysium is currently on patch 1.3 so the stats for the items are different. You can see the current stats by deleting your "wdb" folder in your warcraft installation.)

  * Consumbables
    * **[\[Greater Arcane Elixir\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=13454)**:  This is fairly easy to obtain and you should always have one ready for bosses that aren't on farm.
    * **[\[Flask of Supreme Power\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=13512)**:  This is very expensive (more than 100 gold).  You're going beyond the call of duty if you bring one of these to the raid but we'll all appreciate it.  Be sure to save it for when you know we will be getting at least a few attempts in on a boss that isn't on farm.
    * **[\[Crystal Force\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=11563)**: This is very easy to obtain and will be worth it for long fights where you run out of mana.
    * **[\[Runn Tum Tuber Surprise\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18254)**:  This is the best food for mages and relatively easy to obtain.
    * **[\[Greater Fire Protection Potion\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=13457)**:  We need these for Ragnaros only.
  * General raiding
     * Be on time!  We raid at 20:30 PST, 3:30 server time.
     * Warlocks, Priests, Hunters, Warlocks, Druids, and Paladins are all entitled to be buffed with **[Arcane Intellect]** or **[Arcane Brilliance]** at all times.  Each mage will be assigned to a class or two.  It will be your job to make sure that everyone you have been assigned to is properly buffed.  When someone is resurrected or joins late - buff them.
     *  Be alert as alert for trash as you are for the other bosses on farm.  We never wiped on Golemagg and we have wiped on trash dozens of times.  So Golgemagg is actually **less** important than trash is in terms of how much attention is requires from you.
  * Know the fights
     * **Onyxia**:
       * Phase 1: Doesn't matter how much damage you do here.  Use your wand to make sure that you have full mana when phase 2 starts.
       * Phase 2: We want to make this phase as short as possible.  Hit Onyxia as hard as you can.  AOE the whelps if they get out of hand.  Use **[Fire Ward]** to mitigate damage.  Always know Onyxia's location and blink out of the deep breath zone when you see it coming.
       * Phase 3: Hit Onyxia as hard as you can.  Use **[Fire Ward]** to mitigate damage.
     * **Lucifron**
       * Our primary job on this fight is to cleanse **[\[Lucifron's Curse\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=19703)**. Healers get priority. Feel free to do damage when no one has the curse.
     * **Magmadar**
       * Kill him quick.  If you have 2/2 **[Arctic Reach]** then you can outrange his fear.  Get the fuck away from **[Magma Spit]** and use **[Fire Ward]** to mitigate damage. 
     * **Gehennas**
       * Our primary job on this fight is to cleanse **[\[Gehennas' Curse\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=19716)**.  People with low health get priority.  Feel free to do damage when no one has the curse.  Be sure to blink out of **[Rain of Fire]** and use **[Fire Ward]** to mitigate damage.
     * **Garr**
       * If possible give **[Amplify Magic]** to everyone in the raid before the pull.  This will hopefully allow more important buffs to last longer.
       * We kill the adds one by one and then kill Garr.  Make sure the adds are at the kill spot before they die.
     * **Baron Geddon**
       * Nuke the boss and get the fuck away from everyone else when you receive **[Living Bomb\]**.
     * **Shazzrah**
       * Our primary job on this fight is to cleanse **[\[Shazzrah's Curse\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?spell=19713)**.  Feel free to do damage when no one has the curse.  Get the fuck away from Shazzrah if he is near you.
     * **Sulfuron Harbinger**
       * Just nuke his adds and then him.  Maybe **[Counterspell]** the healers if the rogues aren't doing their job.
     * **Golemagg the Incinerator**
       * Just spam **[Frostbolt]**.  He's a target dummy to us.  Save **[Arcane Power]** for 10% since that's when he enrages.  If you are the target of **[Pyroblast]** use **[Fire Ward]** to mitigate damage.
     * **Majordomo Executus**
       * You'll very likely be assigned a **Flamewaker Healer** to polymorph.  Your top priority is to keep the healer polymorphed until it has been marked to be killed.  Use **[Detect Magic]** to ensure that **[Magic Reflection]** is not active.  Use **[Frost Ward]** to mitigate damage when **[Magic Reflection]** becomes active while your frostbolt is in the air.
     * **Ragnaros**
       * Use a **[\[Greater Fire Protection Potion\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=13457)** once before the fight starts and once during the fight.
       * Find a nice spot by yourself or to share with another ranged damage dealer.  Don't let anyone else be within 25 yards of you.  We want to prevent too many people from being affected by his ranged knockback.
       * Main Phase:  Nuke Ragnaros as hard as you can. If you find yourself flying through the air use **[Blink]** to land quickly and reset your position.  Use **[Fire Ward]** to mitigate damage.
       * Sons Phase:  After 3 minutes Ragnaros will submerge and several **Son of Flame** spawns will appear.  Let the tanks collect **Son of Flame** spawns before you use **[Blizzard]** and **[Frostbolt]** to kill them. Ideally we kill all but one, then kill the last just as Ragnaros reappears 90 seconds after he submerges.  Don't kill the last son too soon or Ragnaros will reemerge sooner.
