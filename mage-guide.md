Our current goal is to get our Onyxia and Molten Core clears as efficient as possible.  We want to 1-shot Onyxia every time and clear MC in 90 minutes.  These are the things you can do to help:

  * Get your pre-raid best in slot gear.  There's a huge difference in damage output between a mage just hitting 60 and a mage who has spent the time to obtain the best items for each slot.  The following is a list I have written specifically for patch 1.3 as it exists on Elysium:
    * Head: [\[Dragonskin Cowl\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=22225) or [\[Cap of the Scarlet Savant\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=12752)
    * Neck: [\[Tempest Talisman\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=18317)
    * Shoulders: [\[Boreal Mantle\]](http://db.vanillagaming.org/?item=11782)
